you should create "/opt/data/media/" directory in your linux system and add r+w permission to this folder


run:

you can upload your picture with upload servcie and get list of file URL for download from download service

get pictures list = baseUrl:8225/DS/images

but first you have to import or upload picture in "/opt/data/media/" directory
